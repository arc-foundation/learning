        New York City, U.S.
    </p>
    <h3 style="text-indent: 200px;">Early Life</h3>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/css/ken.css">

    <p style="text-indent: 200px;"> Feynman was born on May 11, 1918, in Queens, New York City,[2] to Lucille (née
        Phillips; 1895–1981), a
        homemaker,and</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 200px;"> Melville Arthur Feynman (1890–1946), a sales manager.[3] Feynman's father was
        born
        into a Jewish family in
        Minsk,</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 200px;"> Russian Empire,[4] and emigrated with his parents to the United States at the
        age of
        five. Feynman's mother was
        born in</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 200px;"> the United States into a Jewish family. Lucille's father had emigrated from
        Poland,
        and her mother also came
        from a</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 200px;"> family of Polish immigrants. She trained as a primary school teacher but married
        Melville in 1917, before taking
        up a</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 200px;">profession.[2][3] Feynman was a late talker and did not speak until after his
        third
        birthday. As an adult, he
        spoke with</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 200px;"> a New York accent[5][6] strong enough to be perceived as an affectation or
        exaggeration,[7][8] so much so that
        his</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 200px;"> friends Wolfgang Pauli and Hans Bethe once commented that Feynman spoke like a
        "bum".[7]</p>

    <p style="text-indent: 200px;">The young Feynman was heavily influenced by his father, who encouraged him to ask
        questions to challenge
        orthodox</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 200px;">thinking, and who was always ready to teach Feynman something new. From his
        mother,
        he gained the sense of humor
        that he</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 200px;">had throughout his life. As a child, he had a talent for engineering,[9]
        maintained
        an experimental laboratory
        in his</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 200px;">home, and delighted in repairing radios. This radio repairing was probably the
        first
        job Feynman had, and during
        this</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 200px;">time he showed early signs of an aptitude for his later career in theoretical
        physics, when he would analyze the
        issues</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 200px;">theoretically and arrive at the solutions.[10] When he was in grade school, he
        created a home burglar alarm
        system while</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 200px;">his parents were out for the day running errands.[11]</p>

    <p style="text-indent: 200px;">When Richard was five, his mother gave birth to a younger brother, Henry
        Phillips,
        who died at age four
        weeks.[12] Four</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 200px;">years later, Richard's sister Joan was born and the family moved to Far Rockaway,
        Queens.[3] Though separated by
        nine</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 200px;">years, Joan and Richard were close, and they both shared a curiosity about the
        world.[13] Though their mother
        thought</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 200px;">women lacked the capacity to understand such things, Richard encouraged Joan's
        interest in astronomy, and Joan,</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 200px;">eventually became an astrophysicist.</p>


    <h3 style="text-indent: 200px;">About Richard</h3>
    <p style="text-indent: 200px;"> Richard Phillips Feynman (/ˈfaɪnmən/; May 11, 1918 – February 15, 1988) was an
        American theoretical physicist, known for</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 200px;">his work in the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics, the theory of
        quantum
        electrodynamics, the
        physics of</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 200px;">the superfluidity of supercooled liquid helium, as well as his work in particle
        physics for which he proposed
        the parton</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 200px;">model. For his contributions to the development of quantum electrodynamics,
        Feynman
        received the Nobel Prize in
        Physics</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 200px;"> in 1965 jointly with Julian Schwinger and Shin'ichirō Tomonaga.</p>

    <p style="text-indent: 200px;"> Feynman developed a widely used pictorial representation scheme for the
        mathematical
        expressions describing the
        behavior</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 200px;"> of subatomic particles, which later became known as Feynman diagrams. During his
        lifetime, Feynman became one of the</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 200px;"> best-known scientists in the world. In a 1999 poll of 130 leading physicists
        worldwide by the British journal
        Physics</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 200px;">World, he was ranked the seventh-greatest physicist of all time.[1]</p>

    <p style="text-indent: 200px;"> He assisted in the development of the atomic bomb during World War II and became
        known to a wide public in the 1980s
        as</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 200px;"> a member of the Rogers Commission, the panel that investigated the Space Shuttle
        Challenger disaster. Along with his</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 200px;"> work in theoretical physics, Feynman has been credited with pioneering the field
        of
        quantum computing and
        introducing</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 200px;">the concept of nanotechnology. He held the Richard C. Tolman professorship in
        theoretical physics at the California
        Institute of Technology.</p>

    <p style="text-indent: 200px;"> Feynman was a keen popularizer of physics through both books and lectures,
        including
        a 1959 talk on top-down</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 200px;">nanotechnology called There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom and the three-volume
        publication of his undergraduate</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 200px;">lectures, The Feynman Lectures on Physics. Feynman also became known through his
        autobiographical books Surely
        You're</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 200px;">Joking, Mr. Feynman! and What Do You Care What Other People Think?, and books
        written
        about him such as Tuva or
        Bust! by</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 200px;">Ralph Leighton and the biography Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman
        by
        James Gleick.</p>
