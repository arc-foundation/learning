        <p>Stephen Gary Wozniak (/ˈwɒzniæk/; born August 11, 1950), also known by his nickname "Woz", is
                an
                American technology
                entrepreneur, electrical engineer, computer scientist, computer programmer,
                philanthropist, and
                inventor. In 1976, he
                co-founded Apple Computer with his business partner Steve Jobs, which later became the
                world'</p>
        <p>
                largest technology
                company by revenue and the largest company in the world by market capitalization.
                Through his
                work at Apple in the 1970s
                and 1980s, he is widely recognized as one of the most prominent pioneers of the personal
                computer revolution.[4]</p>

        In 1975, Wozniak started developing the Apple I[5]: 150  into the computer that launched
        Apple
        when he and Jobs first
        began marketing it the following year. He primarily designed the Apple II, introduced in
        1977,
        known as one of the firstd microcomputers,[6] while Jobs oversaw the development of
        its
        highly successful mass-produce
        foam-molded plastic case
        and early Apple employee Rod Holt developed its switching power supply.[7] With
        human–computer
        interface expert Jef
        Raskin, Wozniak had a major influence over the initial development of the original Apple
        Macintosh concepts from 1979 to
        1981, when Jobs took over the project following Wozniak's brief departure from the
        company due
        to a traumatic airplane
        accident.[8][3] After permanently leaving Apple in 1985, Wozniak founded CL 9 and
        created the
        first programmable,
        universal remote, released in 1987. He then pursued several other businesses and
        philanthropic
        ventures throughout his
        career, focusing largely on technology in K–12 schools.[3]

        As of February 2020, Wozniak has remained an employee of Apple in a ceremonial capacity
        since
        stepping down in
        1985.[9][10] In recent years, he has helped fund multiple entrepreneurial efforts
        dealing in
        areas such as GPS and
        telecommunications, flash memory, technology and pop culture conventions, technical
        education,
        ecology, satellites and
        more.

                <p>Their first business partnership began later that year when Wozniak read an article titled "Secrets
                        of the Little Blue
                        Box" from the October 1971 issue of Esquire, and started to build his own "blue boxes" that
                        enabled one to make
                        long-distance phone calls at no cost.[26][27] Jobs, who handled the sales of the blue boxes,
                        managed to sell some two
                        hundred of them for $150 each, and split the profit with Wozniak.[28][29] Jobs later told his
                        biographer that if it had
                        not been for Wozniak's blue boxes, "there wouldn't have been an Apple."[30]

                        In 1973, Jobs was working for arcade game company Atari, Inc. in Los Gatos, California.[31] He
                        was assigned to create a
                        circuit board for the arcade video game Breakout. According to Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell,
                        Atari offered $100
                        (equivalent to $659 in 2022) for each chip that was eliminated in the machine. Jobs had little
                        knowledge of circuit
                        board design and made a deal with Wozniak to split the fee evenly between them if Wozniak could
                        minimize the number of
                        chips. Wozniak reduced the number of chips by 50, by using RAM for the brick representation. The
                        fact that this
                        prototype had no scoring or coin mechanisms meant Woz's prototype could not be used. Jobs was
                        paid the full bonus
                        regardless. Jobs told Wozniak that Atari gave them only $700 and that Wozniak's share was thus
                        $350 (equivalent to
                        $2,300 in 2022).[32][5]: 147–148, 180  Wozniak did not learn about the actual $5,000 bonus
                        (equivalent to $33,000 in
                        2022) until ten years later. While dismayed, he said that if Jobs had told him about it and had
                        said he needed the
                        money, Wozniak would have given it to him.[33]: 104–107 

                        In 1975, Wozniak began designing and developing the computer that would eventually make him
                        famous, the Apple I.[34]
                        With the Apple I, Wozniak was largely working to impress other members of the Palo Alto–based
                        Homebrew Computer
                        Club,[35]: 35–38  a local group of electronics hobbyists interested in computing. The club was
                        one of several key
                        centers which established the home hobbyist era, essentially creating the microcomputer industry
                        over the next few
                        decades. Unlike other custom Homebrew designs, the Apple had an easy-to-achieve video capability
                        that drew a crowd when
                        it was unveiled.[36]</p>

                        collection</a>
                <p>By March 1, 1976, Wozniak completed the basic design of the Apple I computer.[13]: 5–6  He alone
                        designed the hardware,
                        circuit board designs, and operating system for the computer.[36] Wozniak originally offered the
                        design to HP while
                        working there, but was denied by the company on five occasions.[39] Jobs then advised Wozniak to
                        start a business of
                        their own to build and sell bare printed circuit boards of the Apple I.[13]: 4–6 [35]: 35–38 
                        Wozniak, at first
                        skeptical, was later convinced by Jobs that even if they were not successful they could at least
                        say to their
                        grandchildren that they had had their own company. To raise the money they needed to build the
                        first batch of the
                        circuit boards, Wozniak sold his HP scientific calculator while Jobs sold his Volkswagen
                        van.[13]: 4–6 [35]: 35–38 

                        On April 1, 1976, Jobs and Wozniak formed the Apple Computer Company (now called Apple Inc.)
                        along with administrative
                        supervisor Ronald Wayne, whose participation in the new venture was short-lived. The two decided
                        on the name "Apple"
                        shortly after Jobs returned from Oregon and told Wozniak about his time spent on an apple
                        orchard there.[40]

                        After the company was formed, Jobs and Wozniak made one last trip to the Homebrew Computer Club
                        to give a presentation
                        of the fully assembled version of the Apple I.[35]: 39–40  Paul Terrell, who was starting a new
                        computer shop in
                        Mountain View, California, called the Byte Shop,[5] saw the presentation and was impressed by
                        the machine.[33]: 66–67 
                        Terrell told Jobs that he would order 50 units of the Apple I and pay $500 (equivalent to $2,570
                        in 2022) each on
                        delivery, but only if they came fully assembled, as he was not interested in buying bare printed
                        circuit
                        boards.[13]: 7 [33]: 66–67 

                        Together the duo assembled the first boards in Jobs's parents' Los Altos home; initially in his
                        bedroom and later (when
                        there was no space left) in the garage. Wozniak's apartment in San Jose was filled with
                        monitors, electronic devices,
                        and computer games that he had developed. The Apple I sold for $666.66. Wozniak later said he
                        had no idea about the
                        relation between the number and the mark of the beast, and that he came up with the price
                        because he liked "repeating
                        digits".[41] They sold their first 50 system boards to Terrell later that year</p>
