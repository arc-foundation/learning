            ABOUT
        </h2>
        <p>
            Margaret Elaine Hamilton, born on August 17, Paoli, Indiana, 1936 is an American computer scientist, systems
            engineer, and business owner. She was director of the Software Engineering Division of the MIT
            Instrumentation Laboratory, which developed on-board flight software for NASA's Apollo program. She later
            founded two software companiesâ€”Higher Order Software in 1976 and Hamilton Technologies in 1986, both in
            Cambridge, Massachusetts.

            Hamilton has published more than 130 papers, proceedings, and reports, about sixty projects, and six major
            programs. She invented the term "software engineering", stating "I began to use the term 'software
            engineering' to distinguish it from hardware and other kinds of engineering, yet treat each type of
            engineering as part of the overall systems engineering process."

            On November 22, 2016, Hamilton received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from president Barack Obama for
            her work leading to the development of on-board flight software for NASA's Apollo Moon missions.

            Hamilton has a sister Kathryn.

            She met her first husband, James Cox Hamilton, in the mid-1950s while attending college. They were married
            on June
            15, 1958, the summer after she graduated from Earlham. She briefly taught high school mathematics and French
            at
            a public school in Boston, Indiana. The couple then moved to Boston, Massachusetts, where they had a
            daughter, Lauren, born on November 10, 1959. They divorced in 1967 and Margaret married Dan Lickly two years
            later.

            EDUCATION
        </h2>
        <p>
            Margaret graduated from Hancock High School in 1954 from Michigan. She studied mathematics at the University
            of Michigan in 1955 before transferring to Earlham College, where her mother
            had been a student. She earned a BA in mathematics with a minor in philosophy in 1958.She cites Florence
            Long, the head of the math department at Earlham, as helping with her desire to pursue abstract
            mathematics and become a mathematics professor.

            Hamilton initially intended to enroll in graduate study in abstract mathematics at Brandeis University,
            Boston. However, in mid-1959, Hamilton began working for Edward Norton Lorenz, in the meteorology department
            at MIT.She developed software for predicting weather, programming on the LGP-30 and the PDP-1 computers at
            Marvin Minsky's
            Project MAC.Her work contributed to Lorenz's publications on chaos theory.She moved on to another project in
            the summer of 1961, and hired and trained Ellen Fetter as her replacement.

            CAREER
        </h2>
        <p>
            From 1961 to 1963, Hamilton worked on the Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) Project at the MIT
            Lincoln Lab,
            where she was one of the programmers who wrote software for the prototype AN/FSQ-7 computer (the XD-1), used
            by the U.S.
            Air Force to search for possibly unfriendly aircraft. She also wrote software for a satellite tracking
            project at the
            Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hamilton then joined the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory, which developed the Apollo Guidance Computer for
            the Apollo
            lunar exploration program. Hamilton was the first programmer hired for the Apollo project and in 1965 became
            Director of
            the Software Engineering Division.She was responsible for the team writing and testing all on board in
            flight software for the Apollo spacecraft's Command
            and Lunar Module and for the subsequent Skylab space station.
        </p>

            During Apollo 11, a critical moment saw the Apollo Guidance Computer facing alarms three minutes before the
            Moon
            landing. Buzz Aldrin's request caused an overload, triggering unexpected errors. Margaret Hamilton's
            "priority display"
            design alerted astronauts, but introduced a synchronization risk. The alarms resulted from an inadvertently
            left-on
            radar switch, causing "executive overflows." Hamilton's software design, with error recovery and priority
            displays,
            enabled the astronauts to decide to continue the landing. Jack Garman in mission control recognized errors,
            shouted "Go,
            go!" and the mission succeeded. Hamilton's work laid the foundation for ultra-reliable software design,
            crucial for
            Apollo 11's success. The computer's ability to recognize and recover from errors was pivotal, as highlighted
            in
            Hamilton's 1971 letter titled "Computer Got Loaded."

        <p>
            In 1976, Margaret Hamilton co-founded Higher Order Software (HOS) with Saydean Zeldin, extending ideas from
            their Apollo
            program experience. They developed USE.IT, based on the HOS methodology, successfully applied in government
            programs.
            Hamilton was HOS CEO until 1984, leaving in 1985. In 1986, she founded Hamilton Technologies, focusing on
            the Universal
            Systems Language (USL) and the 001 Tool Suite for proactive systems design and software development.

            Margaret Hamilton, a pioneering figure in software engineering, received numerous prestigious awards and
            honors
            throughout her career. In 1986, she was honored with the Augusta Ada Lovelace Award by the Association for
            Women in
            Computing. In 2003, NASA recognized her with the Exceptional Space Act Award for significant scientific
            contributions,
            including a historic monetary prize. Over the years, she received accolades such as the Outstanding Alumni
            Award from
            Earlham College in 2009 and the Presidential Medal of Freedom from Barack Obama in 2016. In 2017, the
            Computer History
            Museum honored her with the Fellow Award, and a LEGO set featuring women of NASA, including Hamilton, was
            released.
            Further recognitions include an honorary doctorate from the Polytechnic University of Catalonia in 2018, The
            Washington
            Award in 2019, and induction into the National Aviation Hall of Fame in 2022. Hamilton's extensive list of
            awards
            underscores her exceptional contributions to the field of computer science.

            Margaret Hamilton's notable publications span various aspects of software engineering and systems
            development. In 1976
            and 1979, she co-authored papers with Saydean Zeldin on Higher Order Software methodology and the
            relationship between
            design and verification. In 1994, she contributed articles to Electronic Design on development before the
            fact and the
            001 Full Life Cycle Systems Engineering. Collaborating with W. R. Hackler in 2004 and 2007, they discussed
            principles of
            a common software architecture and the Universal Systems Language for preventative systems engineering.
            Further work in
            2008 explored the formal semantics of Universal Systems Language. In 2018, Hamilton delved into the insights
            derived
            from software errors in an IEEE Software article. These publications reflect her extensive contributions to
            software
            development methodologies, systems engineering, and the lessons learned from the Apollo program.
