    <h1>Richard Feynman</h1>
    <h3>Early Life</h3>
    <p>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/css/ken.css">
        Feynman was born on May 11, 1918, in Queens, New York City,[2] to Lucille (née Phillips; 1895–1981), a
        homemaker,
        and
        Melville Arthur Feynman (1890–1946), a sales manager.[3] Feynman's father was born into a Jewish family in
        Minsk,
        Russian Empire,[4] and emigrated with his parents to the United States at the age of five. Feynman's mother was
        born in
        the United States into a Jewish family. Lucille's father had emigrated from Poland, and her mother also came
        from a
        family of Polish immigrants. She trained as a primary school teacher but married Melville in 1917, before taking
        up a
        profession.[2][3] Feynman was a late talker and did not speak until after his third birthday. As an adult, he
        spoke with
        a New York accent[5][6] strong enough to be perceived as an affectation or exaggeration,[7][8] so much so that
        his
        friends Wolfgang Pauli and Hans Bethe once commented that Feynman spoke like a "bum".[7]

        The young Feynman was heavily influenced by his father, who encouraged him to ask questions to challenge
        orthodox
        thinking, and who was always ready to teach Feynman something new. From his mother, he gained the sense of humor
        that he
        had throughout his life. As a child, he had a talent for engineering,[9] maintained an experimental laboratory
        in his
        home, and delighted in repairing radios. This radio repairing was probably the first job Feynman had, and during
        this
        time he showed early signs of an aptitude for his later career in theoretical physics, when he would analyze the
        issues
        theoretically and arrive at the solutions.[10] When he was in grade school, he created a home burglar alarm
        system while
        his parents were out for the day running errands.[11]

        When Richard was five, his mother gave birth to a younger brother, Henry Phillips, who died at age four
        weeks.[12] Four
        years later, Richard's sister Joan was born and the family moved to Far Rockaway, Queens.[3] Though separated by
        nine
        years, Joan and Richard were close, and they both shared a curiosity about the world.[13] Though their mother
        thought
        women lacked the capacity to understand such things, Richard encouraged Joan's interest in astronomy, and Joan
        eventually became an astrophysicist.[14]
