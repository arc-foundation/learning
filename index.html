        <p class="biography-text">Stephen Gary Wozniak (/ˈwɒzniæk/; born August 11, 1950), also known by his
                nickname "Woz", is
                an
                American technology
                entrepreneur, </p>
        <p class="biography-text">electrical engineer, computer scientist, computer programmer,</p>
        <p class="biography-text"> philanthropist, and
                inventor. In 1976, he
                co-founded Apple Computer with his business partner Steve Jobs, which later became the
                world'</p>
        <p class="biography-text">
                largest technology
                company by revenue and the largest company in the world by market capitalization.
                Through his</p>
        <p class="biography-text">work at Apple in the 1970s
                and 1980s, he is widely recognized as one of the most prominent pioneers of the personal
                computer revolution.[4]</p>

        <p class="biography-text">In 1975, Wozniak started developing the Apple I[5]: 150  into the computer that
                launched
                Apple</p>
        <p class="biography-text"> when he and Jobs first
        <p class="biography-text"> began marketing it the following year. He primarily designed the Apple II,
                introduced in
                1977,</p>
        <p class="biography-text">known as one of the firstd microcomputers,[6] while Jobs oversaw the
                development of
                its</p>

                foam-molded plastic case</p>
        <p class="biography-text"> and early Apple employee Rod Holt developed its switching power supply.[7] With
                human–computer
                interface expert Jef
                Raskin, Wozniak had a major influence over the initial development of the original Apple</p>
        <p class="biography-text"> Macintosh concepts from 1979 to
                1981, when Jobs took over the project following Wozniak's brief departure from the
                company due
                to a traumatic airplane</p>
        <p class="biography-text"> accident.[8][3] After permanently leaving Apple in 1985, Wozniak founded CL 9
                and
                created the<>
                        <p class="biography-text"> first programmable,
                                universal remote, released in 1987. He then pursued several other businesses and</p>

                                career, focusing largely on technology in K–12 schools.[3]</p>

                        <p class="biography-text"> As of February 2020, Wozniak has remained an employee of Apple
                                in a ceremonial
                                capacity

                <p class="biography-text">Their first business partnership began later that year when Wozniak read
                        an article titled "Secrets
                        of the Little Blue</p>
                <p class="biography-text">Box" from the October 1971 issue of Esquire, and started to build his own
                        "blue boxes" that
                        enabled one to make</p>>
                <p class="biography-text">long-distance phone calls at no cost.[26][27] Jobs, who handled the
                        sales of the blue boxes,
                        managed to sell some two</p>
                <p class="biography-text">hundred of them for $150 each, and split the profit with Wozniak.[28][29]
                        Jobs later told his
                </p>
                <p class="biography-text"> biographer that if it had
                        not been for Wozniak's blue boxes, "there wouldn't have been an Apple."[30]</p>

                <p class="biography-text"> In 1973, Jobs was working for arcade game company Atari, Inc. in Los
                        Gatos, California.[31] He
                        was assigned to create a</p>
                <p class="biography-text"> circuit board for the arcade video game Breakout. According to Atari
                        co-founder Nolan Bushnell,
                        Atari offered $100</p>
                <p class="biography-text"> (equivalent to $659 in 2022) for each chip that was eliminated in the
                        machine. Jobs had little
                        knowledge of circuit</p>

                <p class="biography-text"> board design and made a deal with Wozniak to split the fee evenly
                        between them if Wozniak could
                        minimize the number of</p>
                <p class="biography-text">chips. Wozniak reduced the number of chips by 50, by using RAM for the
                        brick representation. The</p>
                <p class="biography-text"> fact that this
                        prototype had no scoring or coin mechanisms meant Woz's prototype could not be used. Jobs was
                </p>
                <p class="biography-text"> paid the full bonus
                        regardless. Jobs told Wozniak that </p>
                <p class="biography-text">Atari gave them only $700 and that Wozniak's share was thus
                        $350 (equivalent to</p>
                <p class="biography-text">$2,300 in 2022).[32][5]: 147–148, 180  Wozniak did not learn about
                        the actual $5,000 bonus</p>
                <p class="biography-text"> (equivalent to $33,000 in
                        2022) until ten years later. While dismayed, he said that if Jobs had told him about it and had
                </p>
                <p class="biography-text">said he needed the
                        money, Wozniak would have given it to him.[33]: 104–107 </p>

                <p class="biography-text">In 1975, Wozniak began designing and developing the computer that
                        would eventually make him
                        famous, the Apple I.[34]
                        With the Apple I, Wozniak was largely working to impress other members of the Palo Alto–based
                </p>
                <p class="biography-text"> Homebrew Computer
                        Club,[35]: 35–38  a local group of electronics hobbyists interested in computing. The club was
                </p>
                <p class="biography-text">one of several key
                        centers which established the home hobbyist era, essentially creating the microcomputer industry
                </p>
                <p class="biography-text"> over the next few
                        decades. Unlike other custom Homebrew designs, the Apple had an easy-to-achieve video capability
                        that drew a crowd when</p>

                        collection</a>
                <p class="biography-text">By March 1, 1976, Wozniak completed the basic design of the Apple I
                        computer.[13]: 5–6  He alone
                        designed the hardware,
                        circuit board designs, and operating system for the computer.[36] Wozniak originally offered the
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: center;"> design to HP while
                        working there, but was denied by the company on five occasions.[39] Jobs then advised Wozniak to
                        start a business of</p>
                <p class="biography-text">their own to build and sell bare printed circuit boards of the Apple
                        I.[13]: 4–6 [35]: 35–38 
                        Wozniak, at first
                        skeptical, was later convinced by Jobs that even if they were not successful they could at least
                        say to their</p>
                <p class="biography-text"> grandchildren that they had had their own company. To raise the money
                        they needed to build the
                        first batch of the
                        circuit boards, Wozniak sold his HP scientific calculator while Jobs sold his Volkswagen
                        van.[13]: 4–6 [35]: 35–38 </p>

                <p class="biography-text"> On April 1, 1976, Jobs and Wozniak formed the Apple Computer Company
                        (now called Apple Inc.)
                        along with administrative
                        supervisor Ronald Wayne, whose participation in the new venture was short-lived. The two decided
                        on the name "Apple"</p>
                <p class="biography-text">hortly after Jobs returned from Oregon and told Wozniak about his time spent
                        on an apple
                        orchard there.[40]</p>

                <p class="biography-text">After the company was formed, Jobs and Wozniak made one last trip to the
                        Homebrew Computer Club
                        to give a presentation
                        of the fully assembled version of the Apple I.[35]: 39–40  Paul Terrell, who was starting a new
                        computer shop in</p>
                <p class="biography-text">Mountain View, California, called the Byte Shop,[5] saw the presentation and
                        was impressed by
                        the machine.[33]: 66–67 
                        Terrell told Jobs that he would order 50 units of the Apple I and pay $500 (equivalent to $2,570
                        in 2022) each on
                        delivery, but only if they came fully assembled, as he was not interested in buying bare printed
                        circuit
                        boards.[13]: 7 [33]: 66–67 

                        Together the duo assembled the first boards in Jobs's parents' Los Altos home; initially in his
                        bedroom and later (when
                        there was no space left) in the garage. Wozniak's apartment in San Jose was filled with
                        monitors, electronic devices,
                        and computer games that he had developed. The Apple I sold for $666.66. Wozniak later said he
                        had no idea about the
                        relation between the number and the mark of the beast, and that he came up with the price
                        because he liked "repeating
                        digits".[41] They sold their first 50 system boards to Terrell later that year</p>
